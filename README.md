# Abstract Coding

## How To Install:
1. Download the abstract-coding directory from Github
2. Move it into your ~/.atom/packages directory
3. The package should be available for use when you next open Atom.

## How To Use:
After writing an abstract line of code, select Packages > Abstract Coder > Translate Code, or use the keyboard shortcut cmd+T to translate it to a line of Python code. In order for the translation to work, the abstract code must be no more than a line long, and the cursor must be on that line. No highlighting is necessary.
